# Door-Locker-System
This project is a smart door lock system using an LCD and keypad. It verifies the password stored in EEPROM via a microcontroller. Correct password opens the door via SPI commands; three wrong attempts lock the system for 5 minutes with buzzer alerts. Users can also change the password securely.
